This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

A app for monitoring if Api/websites are running wtih a simple dashboard. (Work in progress). Wanted to learn more and play around server components and server actions in Next 14.
